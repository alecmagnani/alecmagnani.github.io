This is the first post on my personal site. The purpose of this site will be to  hold my resume, some sample coding projects, and miscellaneous writing.

The site is still new. Honestly, I'm still deciding if I will ever use the "blog" functionality, or if this will just be a portfolio site. For now, check out the [projects page](../../projects) containing some code samples from my github.
